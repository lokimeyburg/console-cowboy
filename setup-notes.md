## Remap Caps-Lock to Escape

Remap your "capslock" key to "escape." Vi was written using an ADM-3A terminal and its keyboard, which you can see here: https://catonmat.net/why-vim-uses-hjkl-as-arrow-keys has the escape-key in a sane place. This should prevent you from having to stretch to hit escape.

To remap your keys on Windows, you need to download Power Toys: https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases
